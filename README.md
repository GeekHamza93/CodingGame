# Quadratic Equation Solver

This Java program solves quadratic equations of the form:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

## How to Use

1. Compile the program:
    ```sh
    javac QuadraticEquationSolver.java
    ```

2. Run the program:
    ```sh
    java QuadraticEquationSolver
    ```

3. Enter the coefficients when prompted:
    ```
    Enter coefficient a: 1
    Enter coefficient b: -3
    Enter coefficient c: 2
    ```

4. The program will output the roots of the quadratic equation.

## Example

For the equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \):
